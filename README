Final Project
NESCAC Baseball Batting Order Optimization

Purpose: A Streamlit web application for predicting number of
         runs and optimizing batting order lineups for collegiate
         baseball games. Users can first select a NESCAC team and
         then a list of players from that team for the simulation.
         Program then runs a Monte Carlo simulation of those
         players to determine the average number of runs that
         batting lineup would score.


Code & How To Run:

    - All of the Python code for the simulation and web application
      is in roster-optimization.py

    - 2021 season data and team logos are in the appropriate 
      subdirectories

    - To run:

        Online: bit.ly/lineup-optimization

        OR

        Locally:
            (1) pip install streamlit (if you haven't already)
            (2) streamlit run roster-optimization.py
                This will open up a local-host version of the web app
